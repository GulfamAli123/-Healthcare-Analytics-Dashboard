# 🏥 Healthcare Analytics Dashboard  
**Built with SQL | Tableau | Power BI | Excel**  
A data-driven exploration of patient healthcare trends to enhance diagnosis, treatment planning, and overall care outcomes.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project processes and visualizes patient health data to uncover meaningful patterns across symptoms, conditions, and treatments. The insights help healthcare teams make informed decisions, streamline workflows, and improve patient care delivery.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data cleaning, transformation, and KPI calculations  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards for patient care, sector performance, and healthcare trends  
- **Tableau** – Visual storytelling with drill-down features for patient statistics and hospital performance  
- **Excel** – Pivot-based dashboards for quick operational insights and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

---

- `Healthcare.sql` – SQL scripts for:
  - Patient demographics, treatment patterns, and sector performance  
  - Key healthcare metrics: patient satisfaction, treatment time, and resource utilization  
  - Aggregations by hospital, sector, and service type

- `Healthcare.pptx` – Final presentation deck includes:
  - Introduction to health management  
  - Importance, trends, and challenges in healthcare  
  - Key skills required in the healthcare sector  
  - Final dashboards from Excel, Power BI, and Tableau  
  - Summary and conclusions

## 📊 Dashboards Included

| Tool      | Dashboard Types   | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Excel     | Dashboard 1, 2    | Patient statistics, treatment records, and healthcare sector analysis |
| Tableau   | Dashboard 1, 2    | Patient satisfaction, sector performance, and demographic trends |
| Power BI  | Dashboard 1, 2    | Operational KPIs, patient flow, treatment effectiveness, and resource management |

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Patient Satisfaction** varies significantly across healthcare sectors, highlighting improvement areas  
- **Critical care units** show the longest treatment times, while **outpatient services** have the highest throughput  
- **Preventive care services** are underutilized in several regions despite high population demand  
- Workforce distribution and **resource allocation** directly impact patient outcomes  
- **Operational bottlenecks** identified in emergency care can reduce wait times and improve service delivery

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- **Hospital Management**: Improve patient throughput, reduce treatment times, and optimize resource allocation  
- **Public Health Planning**: Identify underserved sectors and demographic health trends  
- **Quality Improvement**: Track satisfaction scores, treatment delays, and emergency response times  
- **Policy Development**: Use data to support healthcare reforms and funding allocation

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Normalizing inconsistent patient records and treatment codes  
- Designing visualizations that cater to both strategic policymakers and operational managers  
- Creating advanced calculated fields for KPIs like **utilization rate**, **wait time index**, and **treatment efficiency score**  
- Handling missing demographic and treatment data
